    "# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation and Spending Behavior Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 Project Overview\n",
    "This project analyzes customer demographics and spending behavior using a dataset containing information about **CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1–100)**.  \n",
    "The primary aim is to discover spending trends, identify customer segments, and develop predictive models that help businesses better understand and target their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a blend of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data visualization**, and **machine learning**, this project highlights how factors like income, age, and gender influence spending behavior — and how customers can be grouped into actionable market segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "- Explore the relationships among **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**.  \n",

    "### 🔸 Key Questions Explored\n",
    "- What are the **distributions** of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score?  \n",
    "- Do **men spend more** than women?  \n",
    "- Is **Annual Income correlated** with Spending Score?  \n",
    "- How does **Age** affect spending habits?  \n",
    "- Can we identify **distinct customer groups** based on income and spending?  \n",
    "- Additional explorations:  \n",
    "  - Which income range dominates the dataset?  \n",
    "  - Which gender category has higher representation among top spenders?  \n",
    "  - What’s the relationship between age and income?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Visualizations\n",
    "- **Histograms** for Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.  \n",
    "- **Pairwise Scatter Plots** and **Scatter Matrix** for quick visual correlation checks.  \n",

    "## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Predictive Modeling — *Linear Regression*\n",
    "- **Objective:** Predict *Spending Score* from customer attributes such as Age, Gender, and Annual Income.  \n",
    "- **Model Used:** Linear Regression.  \n",
    "- **Metrics Evaluated:**  \n",
    "  - R² Score  \n",
    "  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  \n",
    "  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Customer Segmentation — *Unsupervised Learning*\n",
    "- **Objective:** Identify clusters of customers with similar spending and income behavior.  \n",
    "- **Algorithms Used:**  \n",
    "  - K-Means Clustering  \n",
    "  - Hierarchical Clustering  \n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:**  \n",
    "  - Elbow Method (Inertia)  \n",
    "  - Silhouette Score  \n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA (Principal Component Analysis) applied for better visualization and interpretability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Results & Insights\n",
    "- **Income vs. Spending:** Customers with higher annual income generally tend to have higher spending scores — though not always strictly linear.  \n",
    "- **Gender Influence:** Female customers displayed slightly higher spending tendencies than males in this dataset.  \n",
    "- **Age Factor:** Younger adults often have higher spending scores, whereas older customers show more conservative spending patterns.  \n",
    "- **Customer Segments Identified:**  \n",
    "  - 🟢 *Cluster 1:* High-income, high-spending — **Premium customers**.  \n",
    "  - 🟣 *Cluster 2:* Low-income, high-spending — **Potential overspenders**.  \n",
    "  - 🔵 *Cluster 3:* High-income, low-spending — **Under-engaged premium group**.  \n",
    "  - 🟠 *Cluster 4:* Average-income, average-spending — **Majority group**.  \n",
